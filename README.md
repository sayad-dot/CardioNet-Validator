# CardioNet-Validator ðŸ«€

A medical machine learning project focused on heart disease detection using clinical parameters. This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, and statistical insights from the Heart Disease UCI dataset to understand patient risk profiles. The goal is to build a foundation for future model development that can help predict heart disease using machine learning techniques.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Information

- **Source**: UCI Heart Disease Dataset
- **Shape**: `(303, 14)`
- **Features**:
  - `age`: Age of the patient
  - `sex`: Sex (1 = male; 0 = female)
  - `cp`: Chest pain type (0-3)
  - `trestbps`: Resting blood pressure
  - `chol`: Serum cholesterol (mg/dl)
  - `fbs`: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false)
  - `restecg`: Resting electrocardiographic results (0-2)
  - `thalach`: Maximum heart rate achieved
  - `exang`: Exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
  - `oldpeak`: ST depression induced by exercise
  - `slope`: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment
  - `ca`: Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy
  - `thal`: Thalassemia (1 = normal; 2 = fixed defect; 3 = reversible defect)
  - `target`: Heart disease (1 = disease present, 0 = not present)

## ðŸ“Š Exploratory Data Analysis

- Verified no missing values in the dataset âœ…
- Summary statistics computed for each column
- Class balance checked for the `target` variable
- Categorical features like `sex`, `cp`, `thal`, `restecg`, `slope`, etc. were analyzed for distribution
- Visualizations (e.g., count plots, histograms, correlation heatmaps) will be included in future commits
